# 📦 GrowTalents – Deployment Repository (Docker + Git Submodule)

This repository is responsible **only for deployment** of GrowTalents backend onto servers (e.g. AWS EC2) using Docker & Docker Compose.  
The **actual source code** of the Spring Boot application is managed separately in the `GrowTalents_BE` repository, which is included here as a Git **submodule** (under the `backend/` folder).
